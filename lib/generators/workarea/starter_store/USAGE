Description:
  Imports a theme in to your host application to kick-start development.
  You must have a single workarea theme installed in your host application.

Examples:
  rails g workarea:starter_store

  This will create all app, config, and test files from your theme in your host
  application.

  It will also import all of the dependencies from the theme's gemspec in to
  your host application's Gemfile. The theme will be commented out in the
  Gemfile as it is no longer needed.
